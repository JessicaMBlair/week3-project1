// Stretch Goals

// 1. Create a function that determines whether a parameter is a number or not (Hint: google "isNan")
//     Iterate over the elements in the following array to determine if each is a number.
       arrayOfAllTheThings = ["one", 23, {thingsWhalesLove: "beaches"}, "six hundred", 33, 6834, "5,435"]

// 2. Create a die rolling function that accepts two parameters (the two six-sided dice) and outputs an array of the two values rolled.

// 3. Create another fuction called "whichSide". It will accept the array from above as it's only parameter.
//     This function will mimic a Monopoly board. Start playerOne at the Go space (0) and add the two values from your die array to determine
//     how many spaces the player will move. Log to the console which side of the board the player is on.
//     Hint: each side has 11 spaces. You can call the sides of the board: north, east, south, west or top, right, bottom, left.

// 4. Using the game above, use the same function(s) and add additional code to determine if the player is on a corner spot.
//     Log to the console which corner the player is located.

// 5. Create a function called "newPerson". The function takes in a first name, last name, phone number and address. Output an object with all of this information, and push it into an array.

// 6. Using the function above, create a function that will loop through an array of objects and return only the first name and the phone number of each person in the array
